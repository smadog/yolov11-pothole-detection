# ðŸŽ¯ Road Pothole Detection 
A test of using the yolo11m model to detect road potholes in 100 epochs.  
Model: yolo11m.pt  
Dataset: pothole-detection URL:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pothole-detection
# ðŸ“¸ Examples
Here are some example outputs from the detector:

### The training curves indicate:

ðŸ“‰ Losses (box, cls, DFL) consistently decrease across training and validation.  
âœ… Precision and recall stabilize around ~0.70 after 80 epochs, but exhibit a fluctuation in the later stages of training.  
ðŸ“ˆ The model achieved a final precision of 0.743, recall of 0.732, mAP50 of 0.806 and mAP50-95 of 0.537ï¼Œindicating the model has acquired a preliminary  capability for pothole identification.Despite the model's unstable performance due to the limited training epochs, there is still significant room for improvement in pothole recognition. However, as a first attempt, the results are acceptable.
